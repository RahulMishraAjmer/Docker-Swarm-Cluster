                          Set up Docker Swarm Cluser on AWS 
************************************************************************************
************************************************************************************

Please note that there is NO support for Docker Community Edition in Radhat Linux that is why we are 
using the Ubuntu, However, You can also use centos based on your requirements.

Prerequisites
======================
1. Set up 3 Ubuntu Machines
   Master -1
   Workers-2
2. Make sure to open following ports in AWS Security Groups as there are very much requied to set up Docker Swarm Cluster
   a. TCP Port 2377: For Cluster Management communications
   b. TCP and UDP port 7946: For communication among nodes
   c. UDP port 4789: For overlay network traffic
   d. ESP port 50: For encrypted overlay network (If you want encrypted overlay communication then only it is required or lese it is optional)
   e. TCP port 80: We will access the deployed application (http) on the cluster through browser
   
   
Steps
==========================

1. Inastall Docker community edition in all 3 servers
	a. sudo curl -fsSL get.docker.com | /bin/bash
2. Add user (ubuntu) to docker group
   sudo usermod -aG docker ${USER}
3. Exit and log back in so that changes can be reflected in the ubuntu user
4. Execute the below commands to initiate docker swarm manager in one of the machine (On the machine that you identify as Cluster Manager)
	# Initialize docker swarm cluster
	docker swarm init  
	# Get worker token
	docker swarm join-token worker
	# You can use the below command to add another machine as the docker swarm manager
	docker swarm join-token manager
	# Add worked machines to cluster
	run the command received by running the 'docker swarm join-token worker' on the worker machines
	# check the list of docker nodes, by running  the below command on manager machine
	docker node ls
5. Deploy sample docker application in the docker swarm cluster
	docker service create --name webserver --replicas=2 -p 80:80 httpd
6. get the public IP of any of the machine (either manager or worker) of the cluster and access it by opening it on the browser as http://<public_ip>:80
